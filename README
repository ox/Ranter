== RANTER

Ranter is an independent system in which users have no identity
and no metrics of any kind are stored on the server, just 
conversations. In this context, free speech exists and it is 
totally democratic in that sense. Nobody can be traced and 
anybody can talk about anything. In essence, democracy on a 
server. Try it out!
